# SP23-CPR-Resuscitation-Scenario-using-Virtual-Reality

## Introduction/Overview
Using Virtual Reality technology we want to test if the average person can benefit from a computer-based training for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Each participant will provide subjective responses in the form of a questionnaire before and after the training module. In addition each particpant will be measured for accuracy and timing for more objective calculations.

##### Checkpoint 6: 04/21/2023
***Post-Module Questionnaire:***
Create post-module questionnaire to acquire participant "overall experience", "new CPR comfort level", and "recommendations for improvement".

##### Checkpoint 7: 05/05/2023
***Calculations and Visualizations:***
Finalize all calculations complete with relevant graphs and other metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and assertion about statisical significance.

##### Final Due Date: 05/07/2023
