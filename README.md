# SP23-CPR-Resuscitation-Scenario-using-Virtual-Reality

## Overview
When learning CPR we want to see if the average person can benefit more from video observation training (VOT) or virtual reality (VR) training. Each participant provided feedback on meta data as well as subjective measures of their CPR comfort. After taking a pre-training assessment for a base line, everybody will be directed to either VOT or VR training. Thereafter, each participant is given the assessment again to measure their improvement and once again asked about the new CPR comfort level. The independent variable, training method, was measured against both of our two dependent variables, CPR Assessment and CPR Comfort.

## Usage Instructions
When you run the code, the very first screen is displayed below. The researcher manually chose the group assignment on a rotating schedule.  The "Test Only" option was provided for code testing and debugging purposes. Once the researcher selected one of the options, it would go to the next slide and authority was passed on to the participant starting on the 2nd screen.
