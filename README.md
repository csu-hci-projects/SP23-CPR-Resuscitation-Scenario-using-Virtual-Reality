# SP23-CPR-Resuscitation-Scenario-using-Virtual-Reality

## Introduction/Overview
Using Virtual Reality technology we want to test if the average person can benefit from a computer-based training for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Each participant will provide subjective responses in the form of a questionnaire before and after the training module. In addition each particpant will be measured for accuracy and timing for more objective calculations.
