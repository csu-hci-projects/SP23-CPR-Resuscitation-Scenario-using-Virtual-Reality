# SP23-CPR-Resuscitation-Scenario-using-Virtual-Reality

## Introduction/Overview
Using Virtual Reality technology we want to test if the average person can benefit from a computer-based training for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Each participant will provide subjective responses in the form of a questionnaire before and after the training module. In addition each particpant will be measured for accuracy and timing for more objective calculations.

## Timeline
##### Checkpoint 1:
02/25/2023- Environment setup:
All dependencies and integrations are fully installed and ready for use for all team members

##### Checkpoint 2:
03/10/2023- Welcome and Pre-Module Questionnaire:
All relevant code to welcome our particpants to the study and provide all necessary research details. In addition the pre-module questionnaire should be fully created. This questionnaire should generate a random "Participant ID", query participants "age" and "base CPR comfort level".

##### Checkpoint 3:
03/24/2023- Education segment:
All education should be completed for CPR purpose, AED purpose, crisis recognition, preliminary response, CPR process, AED process, and recovery.

##### Checkpoint 4:
04/14/2023- CPR Administration Module:
Create the scenario complete with environment setup, initial briefing, victim creation, resource manipulation, audio output, and all relevant measures (timer, step-by-step Q&A analysis, etc.).

##### Checkpoint 5:
04/21/2023- Post-Module Questionnaire:
Create post-module questionnaire to acquire participant "overall experience", "new CPR comfort level", and "recommendations for improvement".

##### Checkpoint 6:
05/05/2023- Calculations and Visualizations:
Finalize all calculations complete with relevant graphs and other metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and assertion about statisical significance.

##### Final Due Date: 
05/07/2023- Final submission:
Payday
