### Works Completed So Far:
| Member | Contribution List |
| - | - |
| Matt | VR environment and victim staged, basic gestures and interaction helpers in place |
| Nika | UI Storyboard |
| Hunter | 2D introduction. Added C# script to send data question data to google form/google sheets | 
| Donnie | Designed experiment. Compiled and created questionnaires and assessments questions |

### Work to be Compelted:
| Member | Pending List |
| - | - |
| Matt | Finish issues list for the VR side of the experiment. Most issues are centered around interaction of the victim and the 5 steps of CPR |
| Nika | Add menu features, instructional video, general instructions to the VR simulation and other features for the simulation TBD, organize participants for experiment, collect data, statistical analysis of data |
| Hunter | Finish the 2D implementation. Finish the integration and code the 2D unity side into the project (warning screen, post questionnaires, and the pre/post-module assessments) so there is a smooth transition from 2D to 3D back to 2D. Polish the 2D implementation that is already done, like incorrect spacing, and inconsistency of words from scenes. Help with VR implementation |
| Donnie | Continue implementing 2D graphics and scenes with Hunter. Assist as needed with VR simulation |
